                    <p>The Maldives is a tropical paradise located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Sri Lanka.
                         Known for its stunning white-sand beaches, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and vibrant coral reefs,
                          the Maldives is a top destination for luxury travelers and honeymooners. The country is made up of 26 atolls,
                           comprising over 1,000 small islands, many of which host private resorts that offer overwater bungalows and 
                           unparalleled views of the surrounding ocean. With a rich marine life, the Maldives is also a premier spot 
                           for diving and snorkeling. Its warm climate, idyllic scenery, and serene atmosphere make it a dream 
                           destination for relaxation and adventure alike.

                    <h1>Maldives flag</h1>
                    <p>The flag of the Maldives, adopted on July 26, 1965, marks the country's independence. It features a red field for courage, a green 
                        rectangle for peace, and a white crescent moon symbolizing Islam. The design reflects the Maldives' cultural heritage and Islamic
                         identity, evolving from earlier Sultanate-era flags.

                    <h1>Bioluminescence
                        Beaches in The Maldives</h1>
                    <p>The Maldives is famous for its bioluminescent beaches,
                         where tiny plankton glow blue at night, creating a magical effect as waves and movement disturb the water. 
                         This natural light show is especially visible on islands like Vaadhoo and Hulhule, offering a stunning,
                          starry-like spectacle.
                        </p>
